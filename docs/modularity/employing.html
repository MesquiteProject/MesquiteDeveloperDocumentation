		<h2>Modules employing other modules</h2>
		
<p>(updated August 2005)</p>
		<p>As explained in the user's introduction to modularity and the introduction to Mesquite's modular architecture, Mesquite modules hire other modules as employees to help them perform tasks. Thus, there is an employee tree like a corporate bureaucratic hierarchy. This can be seen by touching on the Modules tab in the information bar of any window:</p>
		<p><img src="../images/employeeTree.gif"></p>
		<h3>The employment system</h3>
		
<p>The methods handling employment are in the superclass <a href="../javadoc/mesquite/lib/EmployerEmployee.html">EmployerEmployee</a> 
  of MesquiteModule. (Note: the only subclass of EmployerEmployee is MesquiteModule. 
  The code was divided into two levels for manageability, to separate the many 
  methods into two smaller collections of methods.) Employees are stored in a 
  vector (obtainable by getEmployeeVector()) and each module stores a reference 
  to its employer (getEmployer()). Typically employers command their employees 
  directly by their methods (less commonly by doCommand). It is considered bad 
  form, though is sometimes done, for employees to manipulate their employers 
  directly, in part because employees can't assume what type of module hired them. 
  Employees typically communicate with their employers by calling parametersChanged(), 
  which sends a message up the employer hierarchy that an employee's parameters 
  have changed and recalculations may be needed. </p>
		<h3>Hiring employees</h3>
		<p>Hiring employees is often done in the startJob method of a module as it is starting up. There are two common styles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a request is made to hire an unspecified module to perform a particular duty. This is usually done by the method <b>hireEmployee</b>. For example, a module needing a source of trees may call<br>
    treeSourceModule = (TreeSource)hireEmployee(commandRecord, TreeSource.class, 
    &quot;Source of trees&quot;);<br>
    The first argument, commandRecord, stores the context of execution (this argument 
    will probably be abandoned by Mesquite version 1.2). The second argument, 
    TreeSource.class, indicates what type of employee to hire. If more than one 
    of that type of module is available, and the boolean scripting is false, then 
    the user will be queried via a dialog box which module to hire as long as 
    the current thread of execution is not commanded by a script, in which case 
    the dialog box would be unwise (whether the context is scripting is stored 
    in the CommandRecord). The String passed is shown in the dialog box as an 
    explanation for the user. If hireEmployee is unsuccessful at hiring the module, 
    it will return null. The employer typically needs to keep a reference to the 
    employee hired (here, in the variable &quot;treeSourceModule&quot;) for later 
    use. 
  <li>a specifically named module is requested.  For example, a module may want only the tree source &quot;Stored Trees&quot;.  It would use <b>hireNamedEmployee</b>, as in<br>
    treeSourceModule = (TreeSource)hireNamedEmployee(commandRecord, TreeSource.class, 
    &quot;Stored Trees&quot;);<br>
		</ul>
		
<p>If an employee is needed which satisfies a given condition (e.g., it can work 
  with continuous-valued data), the method hireCompatibleEmployee is known, and 
  the condition is passed as a parameter. A common compatibility condition is 
  type of data. For instance, passing ContinuousState.class as a condition when 
  hiring a CharacterSource ensures that the CharacterSource can and will supply 
  only continuous-valued data. </p>
		<h3>Replacing existing employees</h3>
		<p>Replacing of existing employees is typically done in the doCommand method in response to user or script commands to swap one employee for another.  The methods used are <b>replaceEmployee</b> or <b>replaceCompatibleEmployee</b>.  An example of replaceEmployee is seen in the <a href="../exampleModule/exampleEmployment.html">example module</a>.</p>
		<h3>Employees quitting</h3>
		
<p>An employee can quit by calling its iQuit() method. This closes down the employee, 
  and notifies the employer. If the employer had attached a hiring command to 
  the employee on hiring (via setHiringCommand()), the employee attempts to use 
  the hiring command to find a replacement employee for itself. That is, the employee 
  attempts to find a suitable replacement and get the employer to hire the replacement 
  by calling hiring command's doIt method, passing along the name of the replacement 
  as an argument. On the other hand, if the employer hadn't attached a hiring 
  command, or if hiring a replacement had been unsuccessful, the employee simply 
  calls its employer's employeeQuit() method. Modules should override their employeeQuit() 
  method to see if an vital employee has quit. If so, the employer itself could 
  choose to quit.</p>
